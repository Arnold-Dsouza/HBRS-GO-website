   - Parses contact info, hours, announcements

3. **📊 Smart Content Processing**
   - Removes ads, navigation, scripts
   - Extracts meaningful text content
   - Focuses on relevant information

4. **🛡️ Safety & Security**
   - Only fetches from trusted HBRS domains
   - Rate limiting and timeout protection
   - Graceful error handling

## 🎯 Enhanced Search Triggers

The chatbot now searches for current info when you ask about:

### **Contact & Hours**
- "What are HBRS opening hours?"
- "How can I contact HBRS?"
- "What's the phone number for admissions?"
- "Where is the international office?"

### **Current Information**  
- "What are the latest admission deadlines?"
- "Are there any recent announcements?"
- "What events are happening this week?"
- "What's new at HBRS?"

### **Specific Services**
- "Library opening hours"
- "Mensa menu today" 
- "Student services contact"
- "IT support information"

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Multi-Tier Search Strategy**

```javascript
// Strategy 1: Professional Search API
if (searchApiKey) {
  searchWithSerper(query) → Get Google results + fetch page content
}

// Strategy 2: Free Search APIs  
searchWithBrave(query) → Alternative search results

// Strategy 3: Direct Website Fetching
fetchHBRSWebsiteContent(query) → Visit official HBRS pages directly

// Strategy 4: Fallback Search
searchWithSerpAPI(query) → Additional search option
```

### **Smart Content Extraction**

```javascript
fetchPageContent(url) {
  // 1. Security check - only HBRS domains
  // 2. Fetch HTML content
  // 3. Remove scripts, styles, navigation
  // 4. Extract meaningful text
  // 5. Return relevant content
}
```

## 🎪 Testing Examples

## 🔧 Optional Enhancements

### **For Better Results** (Optional)
Add any of these API keys to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Best option: Serper.dev (2,500 free searches/month)
SEARCH_API_KEY=your_serper_key_here

# Alternative: SerpAPI (100 free searches/month)  
SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key_here

# Another option: Brave Search
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_key_here
```

**But it works great without any additional keys!**
