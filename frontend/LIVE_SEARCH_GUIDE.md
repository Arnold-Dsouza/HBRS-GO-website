# HBRS Gemini Chatbot with Live Search

Your HBRS chatbot now has **live web search capabilities** that can fetch current information from the internet and combine it with Gemini AI's intelligence!

## üöÄ New Features

### ‚úÖ **Smart Search Detection**
The chatbot automatically detects when you're asking for current information:
- Questions with words like: "current", "latest", "recent", "now", "today", "2025"
- Topics like: "schedule", "deadlines", "admission", "semester dates", "new programs"

### ‚úÖ **Multi-Tier Search Strategy**
1. **Primary**: Professional Search API (if configured)
2. **Fallback**: DuckDuckGo API (free, no key needed)
3. **Guidance**: Helpful directions to official sources

### ‚úÖ **Source Transparency**
- üåê Responses clearly indicate when information comes from web search
- üìö Shows when using knowledge base vs. live data
- Always references official HBRS sources

## üîß Setup Options

### Option 1: Basic Setup (Free)
Your chatbot already works with free search using DuckDuckGo:
- No additional setup required
- Works immediately
- Limited search results but functional

### Option 2: Enhanced Search (Recommended)
For better search results, add a search API key:

1. **Get a Free Search API Key:**
   - Visit [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev) (2,500 free searches/month)
   - Or try [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com) (100 free searches/month)

2. **Add to Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Add this line to your .env.local file
   SEARCH_API_KEY=your_search_api_key_here
   ```

## üéØ How It Works

### Automatic Search Triggers
The chatbot searches for live information when you ask questions like:
- "What are the current admission deadlines for HBRS?"
- "What new programs does HBRS offer in 2025?"
- "What are the latest semester dates?"
- "Are there any recent announcements from HBRS?"

### Knowledge Base Questions
For general questions, it uses the built-in knowledge:
- "What departments does HBRS have?"
- "Where are the HBRS campuses located?"
- "What is HBRS known for?"

## üß™ Testing Examples

Try these questions to see the live search in action:

### Current Information (Triggers Search)
```
- "What are the current admission deadlines for HBRS?"
- "What events are happening at HBRS this semester?"
- "What are the latest course offerings in computer science?"
- "Are there any recent news from HBRS?"
```

### General Information (Uses Knowledge Base)
```
- "What programs does HBRS offer?"
- "How many campuses does HBRS have?"
- "What is the history of HBRS?"
```
