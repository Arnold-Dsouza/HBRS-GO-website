# To help reduce your Heroku slug size, review these files:
# - largest_files.txt: List of all files, largest first
# - largest_files_detailed.txt: Detailed table with file sizes
#
# Open these files and check for any large files or folders that can be deleted or added to .slugignore.
# Common culprits: local databases, binaries, large images, test data, or node_modules not ignored.
